\textbf{\LARGE{Declaration}}

I, Luke Sheeran of Pembroke College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer Science Tripos, hereby declare that this dissertation and the work
described in it are my own work, unaided except as may be specified below, and that
the dissertation does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.

\section{Preparation}
    All the work that was completed before any code was written.
\begin{itemize}
\item The CHIP-8 architecture

Problem instructions - Clear the Display, Random Number, Write all registers to the stack
Very tricky - Anything todo with timers!!
\item LLVM Compiler Framework

Chip-8 is in a list, output LLVM is a list / AST. Mappings are 1 to 1 with exceptions. Data driven translation vs hard coded translation.

\item Language/Grammar structure comparisons
\item Languages and Skills
\item How to know what can safely be done at compile time
\end{itemize}
Can you use the same shape syntax tree between the CHIP-8 and the LLVM code?
Writing what the LLVM code you would like to produce would look like
